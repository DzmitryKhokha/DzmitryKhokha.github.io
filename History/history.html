                  In a broad sense, the internationally recognized term barbecue combines all sorts of ways
                  cooking products (traditionally meat, but the term has also spread to the preparation of fish, poultry,
                  vegetables, fruits, desserts, toasting slices of bread) in the heat of coal, gas or electric heat
                  heater - this is shish kebab, and grill, and kebab, and khorovats, and mtsvadi, and braai, and shurasko, and yakiniku.
                  The word acquired this meaning in the 1940s and 50s in connection with the widespread suburban culture,
                  primarily in English-speaking countries.

                  In fact, researchers are inclined to believe that the island of Haiti was the birthplace of barbecue. African
                  the population of the island cooked meat on slowly smoldering coals from raw wood, and this method was called
                  Barbacoas. The green branches of tropical trees were used as fuel, which is why the meat acquired
                  deep smoky taste. The very word "Barbacoa" probably comes from the Caribbean dialect and the word "barabicu".
                  according to other sources, the origin of the term "barbecue" refers to the French expression
                  "barbe Ã  queue", meaning from beard to tail. In this case, this meant that this method can
                  fry almost any part of the animal carcass.

                  The ancient Haitian way was not only an opportunity to get delicious and fragrant meat, but also served
                  several other purposes at once. Firstly, the aroma of slow-cooked meat was very loved by numerous
                  spirits that were found in abundance in the islands of the Caribbean. Secondly, the smell of meat scared away
                  wild animals, which in those days were no less than spirits. Thus, the barbecue combo effect played on
                  the hand of its popularization and the method quickly became the property of European lovers of delicious. Samo Caribbean
                  the word barabicu means "pit of sacred fire". The analogies with sacrifices are very clearly traced here,
                  which, however, no one particularly hid. Since ancient times, the smell of fried meat has been the main aromatic
                  the passion of the gods of all time, and with the voodoo pantheon there was no exception.

                  In the description of the indigenous peoples of North America, there are many references to the fact that the local Indians
                  they are very fond of dancing, as well as "going to the forest to cook and eat barbecue there." First
                  American President George Washington was very fond of eating meat on the coals and even organized mass
                  barbecue meetings during his campaign period. When he won over
                  the British and the independence of the United States was proclaimed, barbecues were held all over the country to celebrate.
                  When Washington laid the stone in 1793 at the construction site of the Capitol, not only was
                  a solemn parade, but also a whole bull weighing more than two hundred kilograms is roasted on a spit over the coals.

                  The term "barbecue" began to gain popularity in the English language at the beginning of the 19th
                  century, when the country began covered with a network of roads and numerous eateries appeared near
                  them. Cook juicy steaks on charcoal was a common thing for cowboys - professional cattle drivers who
                  ate the same as
                  distilled.

                  A modern barbecue is, of course, a special hearth where you can cook both meat and any
                  other products. An important moment in the history of the development of barbecue was the invention of a semi-finished wood product.
                  coal, which played a very important role in the development of the culinary method. This charcoal has been patented
                  in 1897 and was produced even at the factories of Henry Ford.

                  In the 1950s, a special spherical barbecue cauldron was invented, which was invented by a simple welder from
                  Chicago George Stephen. It was his prototype of the brazier that became the reference for barbecue and is used with small
                  changes to this day. The shape of the brazier has become very successful for gas barbecue-themed modifications,
                  which have also become very popular nowadays.
