            <h2>Secrets of Using Grilling Spices</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="secrets__item-content-info">
            <p>Among other things, the taste of a dish determines which spices and herbs are used in it. When it comes
              to grilling, their influence cannot be written off, and on the contrary, they should be selected more
              carefully. Spice therapist Lior Lev Serkazh, and at the same time a big fan of grilled dishes, knows
              this better than anyone else. While the fire season is still in full swing, the spice master dares to
              share his grilling secrets and signature seasoning recipes that are the perfect addition to any
              barbecue.</p>

            <h2>Use hotter spices</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="secrets__item-content-info">
            <p>There is no better time to experiment with seasonings than summer. This is the time for bold, spicy
              and pungent scents. A universal seasoning with which it is impossible to miscalculate is onion and
              garlic. If you add them raw to salads or grilled vegetables, you will definitely not be mistaken in
              your choice. One of my favorite vegetable spices is cumin. It makes their aroma "meaty" and also
              perfectly complements grilled dishes.</p>

            <h2>Make your own spice mix</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="secrets__item-content-info">
            <p>The grill loves different spice mixes, and this is a great reason to make a versatile mix from your
              favorite additions to dishes that is equally well suited for grilling meats, vegetables and fish, as
              well as salads. There are three basic mixing rules you need to remember before you rush into the spice
              mill for all your favorite jars. First, each spice you want to add must be tasted separately. Second,
              it is important to strike a balance; there should be no more than 3-5 spices that have sour, spicy and
              sweet notes, as well as a different texture. And thirdly, you should not grind all the spices into
              powder, some of them open up much better in the form of "coarse crumbs".</p>

          </div>
          <div class="secrets__item-content-info">
            <p>Whenever I grill for my friends and family, I roast something over the fire whose aroma literally
              drives everyone crazy - pita bread. I grease it with oil and season it before I put it on the grill.
              It can be eaten without everything, or used as a base for grilled fish and meat. By the end of the meal,
              the lavash will absorb all the juices from the meat and it will simply be impossible to tear it away
              from it.</p>

            <h2>Experiment with different grilling methods</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="secrets__item-content-info">
            <p>For those who are not accustomed to cooking over an open fire, the grill instills fear. Grilling is
              very easy, though. And this can be done not only on the grate. Sometimes I cook directly over charcoal
              in a frying pan or in a saucepan, but this is just one of many ways. On the grill, you can smoke or, for
              example, bury onions and potatoes directly in the coals for an incredible smoky flavor.</p>
